# 1. create a directory lab2_hdfs in your HDFS home directory

hdfs dfs -mkdir lab2_hdfs

# 2. upload the files part-00000 through part-00003 into that directory 
# (you can find them on canvas)
hdfs dfs -put part* /lab2_words


# 3. move these files to a new HDFS directory called lab2_words
hdfs dfs -put part* /lab2_words


# 4. delete the lab2_hdfs directory
hdfs dfs -rmr lab2_hdfs
-skipTrash to avoid trash file


# 5. Display the last 1kb of the part-00002 file that you earlier put in HDFS
hdfs dfs -tail lab2_words/part-00002


# 6. Display information about the filesize in bytes, replication information, 
# user name of the file owner, and modification date for the part-00001 file
# that you earlier put in HDFS
hdfs dfs -du -h lab2_words/part-00001
hdfs dfs -ls lab2_words/part-00001
